CVL provides several tools and services to facilitate easy and fast explorative research.

## Data search
CVL uses a system developed at Norwegian Meteorological Institute called "Metsis" that performs search across multiple datacenters.
Subsets of products hosted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute can be imported directly in the processing environment.

## Visualization
CVL provides a tool called "CVL 3D VIZ" that can visualize geospatial products in three dimensional space.
The viewer is a browser based tool and the additional software, including jupyter notebooks and CVL 3D Viz server are packaged as containers,
thus eliminating the need to install any software except container environment.
