    During fall/winter period CVL will announce a public Early Adopters call. The main purpose is to collect feedback
    from users on the user experience and functionality of the system.
    <br>
    We will ask you to submit proposals for small research projects where CVL can provide an additional value.
    Selected applications will receive support from the European Space Agency.
