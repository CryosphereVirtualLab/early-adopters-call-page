Subsets of products hosted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute can be imported directly in the processing environment.\nVisualization CVL provides a tool called “CVL 3D VIZ” that can visualize geospatial products in three dimensional space. The viewer is a browser based tool and the additional software, including jupyter notebooks and CVL 3D Viz server are packaged as containers, thus eliminating the need to install any software except container environment.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"CVL provides several tools and services to facilitate easy and fast …","ref":"/docs/tooling/","tags":"","title":"Tools"},{"body":"Overview During fall/winter period of 2021 CVL consortium will release an Early Adopters Open Call.
